# Data and Particle Swarm Algorithm Optimizer associated with Partial Least Square for pigment spectrophotometric quantification

Repository hosting the Python codes (please be kind with the typos in the comments) and data associated with the article:
[Lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin spectrophotometric quantification: a machine learning approach.](https://www.springer.com/journal/10811)
Pozzobon, V., & Camarena-Bernard, C. (2022).
*Journal of Applied Phycology*, pp-pp.

It has been tested successfully on October 2022.

## Data structure

The whole curated dataset is contained within _Pigment_Spectra_full.npy_ (and _Pigment_Spectra_full.txt_) (80 measurements). It was randomly split into _Pigment_Spectra_train.npy_ (and _Pigment_Spectra_train.txt_) containing 80 % of the data and _Pigment_Spectra_valid.npy_ hosting the remaining part. Individual measurements are stored as columns. The 461 first items are the spectrophotometric readings (from 340 to 800 nm), followed by the spectra derivatives (features 462 to 814) and the 5 remaining rows are chlorophyll _a_ (item 815), chlorophyll _b_ (item 816), zeaxanthin (item 817), lutein (item 818), violaxanthin (item 819) concentrations. Files are available in the _Data_ folder.
